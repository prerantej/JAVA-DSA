# Functions

## Function Structure
In Java, functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They are defined using the `void` keyword if they don't return any value, or with the data type of the value they return. Here's a basic structure of a Java function:

```java
public returnType functionName(parameters) {
    // Function body
    // Code to perform a specific task
    return value; // (if applicable)
}
```

## Pass by Value in Java
In Java, arguments are passed to functions by value. This means that a copy of the variable's value is passed to the function, rather than the actual variable itself. Therefore, modifications made to the parameters inside the function do not affect the original variables outside the function.
